BUSINESS CASE : 
Sharon works for a social media agency - head of marketing. She wants to run successful marketing campaigns with successful youtubers from the USA. She has a budget approved by the board so she wants to be certain where to channel the budget towards.


Objective :

USE CASES AND DATA REQUIRED : 
1. Identify the top Youtubers to run campaigns with

2. Analyze the potential for marketing campaigns with Youtubers

User story

This allows Sharon to achieve a good ROI and build relationships with Youtubers for future collaborations, which leads to recognition within the company.
INFORMATION NEEDED
Sharon needs the top Youtubers in the USA, and the key metrics needed include : 

Subscriber count
Videos uploaded
Views
Average views
Subscriber engagement ratio
Views per subscriber

DATA NEEDED
The dataset to produce the information we need should include the following fields : 

Channel name (string)
Total subscribers (integer)
Total videos uploaded (integer)
Total views (integer)

Focus on the top 100 Youtubers

DATA QUALITY CHECKS 
We need to add measures in place to confirm the dataset contains the data required without any issues - here are some of the data quality checks we need to conduct : 

Row count check
Column count check
Data type check
Duplicate check

ADDITIONAL REQUIREMENTS 
Document the solution and include the data sources, transformation processes and walk through on analysis conclusions
Make source code and docs available on GitHub
Ensure the solution is reproducible and maintainable so that it can support future updates

Note * : once we have this outlined, we run it by Sharon to make sure everything is in line and we have all the information we need and that we have set the right path to acceptable analysis




GOALS FOR DATA CLEANING IN MICROSOFT SQL MANAGEMENT SERVER : 
1.  Remove the unnecessary  columns by only selecting the ones we need
2.  Extract the YouTube channel names from the first column
3.  Rename the column names using aliases 

(1)
select
    u.name
  , u.total_subscribers
  , u.total_views
  , u.total_videos
from	
    us_top_youtubers_2024 u


(2)
charindex :
select
    u.name
  , charindex('@', u.name) as position
from
    us_top_youtubers_2024 u;


select
    cast(substring(u.name, 1, charindex('@', u.name)-1) as varchar(100)) as channel_name
  , u.total_subscribers
  , u.total_views
  , u.total_videos
from	
	us_top_youtubers_2024 u


THEN WE USE THIS NEW TABLE TO CREATE A VIEW : 

create view view_us_youtubers_2024 as (
select
    cast(substring(u.name, 1, charindex('@', u.name)-1) as varchar(100)) as channel_name
  , u.total_subscribers
  , u.total_views
  , u.total_videos
from	
    us_top_youtubers_2024 u
	)

Note * : create this view in order to import into power BI later - to ensure only relevant data is imported





DATA TESTING (IMPORTANT): 
#Data quality tests

1. The data needs to be 100 records of YouTube channels (row count test)
2. The data needs 4 fields (column count test)
3. The channel name column must be string format, and the other columns must be numerical data types (data type check)
4. Each record must be unique in the dataset (duplicate count check)

Row count - 100
Column count - 4

Data Types

channel_name = VARCHAR
total_subscribers = integer or numerical
total_views = integer or numerical
total_videos = integer or numerical

Duplicate count = 0
